# SwiftPOS - A Lightweight Point of Sale System

SwiftPOS is a modern, lightweight, and offline-first point of sale (POS) system designed for small to medium-sized retail businesses (MSMEs). It's a single-page application that runs entirely in the browser, requiring no backend server or internet connection for its core functionality. All data is stored locally in your browser, ensuring privacy and immediate access.

## Features

- **Dashboard**: Get an at-a-glance overview of your business with key metrics like total sales, profit, and product counts. Visualize trends with charts for daily sales, monthly profit, best-selling products, and sales by category.
- **Product Management**: Easily add, edit, and delete products. Include details like images, categories, stock levels, buying/selling prices, and supplier information.
- **Sales Interface**: A user-friendly sales screen with a product grid, category filters, and a dynamic shopping cart. Process sales quickly with support for discounts and multiple payment methods.
- **Expense Tracking**: Log all your business expenses, categorize them, and view detailed expense reports to manage your finances effectively.
- **Supplier & Customer Management**: Keep a directory of your suppliers and customers with their contact information.
- **Reporting**: Generate detailed reports for sales, inventory, profit, and expenses for any date range.
- **Offline First**: The application is designed to work completely offline. All data is saved in your browser's local storage.
- **Data Management**: Export all your application data (products, sales, etc.) to a single JSON file for backup. You can also import data from a backup file to restore your system.

## Setup and Usage

There is no complex setup required. Simply open the `DS_FV_22_SEP_PM.html` file in a modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.

1.  **Download**: Download the repository files to your computer.
2.  **Open**: Navigate to the folder where you saved the files and double-click `DS_FV_22_SEP_PM.html`.
3.  **Start**: The application will launch in your default web browser, and you can start using it immediately.

## How Data is Stored

**Important:** SwiftPOS uses your browser's **Local Storage** to save all data. This means:
-   Your data is stored on your computer, within the specific browser you are using.
-   Data is not shared between different browsers (e.g., data saved in Chrome will not be available in Firefox).
-   Clearing your browser's cache or site data will permanently delete all your POS data.

It is highly recommended to use the **Export Data** feature in the **Settings** tab regularly to create backups of your data.
